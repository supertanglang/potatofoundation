This project will be available on March 2010
Native C++ programmers will be able to easily develop high-performance  asynchronous server application that persists connections with peer clients.
The project will be deployed in form of a "pure" DLL that will only rely on the STL library and Windows Server native API.
A test application is also planned as well as a visualization tool to remotely observe server performance in real time.

See you soon.



Update -- ultimately potatofoundation has been deployed on http://www.pushframework.com under the name of Push Framework.
